# Homeshick: Base

This package contains a set of configuration files to setup a system the
way I like it on macOS and Linux with the support of homeshick. There are
multiple repositories each with another focus.

## Install

There are several pre-requirements needed before you install these scripts,
but you can execute the following command to get it done by the installer.
This script works as an updater too.

```console
curl -sSLo- https://raw.github.com/tboerger/homeshick-base/master/install | bash
```
